# Network Flow Simulation

This project implements various algorithms for solving the maximum flow problem in network graphs. The implemented algorithms include Shortest Augmenting Path (SAP), DFS-like, Max-Capacity (MaxCap), and Random Path.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.0
- Required Python packages (only inbuilt python libraries are used)
- ASCII encodings of all your source-sink graphs as input to your simulation code, one
file per graph. (provided in the repo file)

## Installation

1. Pull the code with git pull.
2. Navigrate to the project folder with executable files.

## Running Simulations and Test

### To perform simulations and obtain results, execute the main script:

```bash
python algo_project.py
```
